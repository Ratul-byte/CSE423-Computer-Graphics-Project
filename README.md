# Computer Graphics Project

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This is a small project developed during our university's computer graphics course. We utilized Python and its OpenGL libraries, drawing inspiration from YouTube tutorials, ChatGPT, StackOverflow, and various other free online resources.

## Project/Game Description:
Experience a captivating 2D top-view game where a single car maneuvers through obstacles. The car starts with three lives, and colliding with obstacles deducts one life. Three obstacles will generate in every loop and among them two of them are fake, therefore hitting them will not cost you any life; thus giving you the option to take the risk or not. Moreover, colliding with point shapes awards the player a point, whereas encountering reverse diamond shapes provides an additional life. The game dynamically changes the environment around the moving car, showcasing roads, trees, and squared obstacles generated through midpoint line and midpoint circle algorithms. Last but not least, for an enriched experience, I've integrated a music track from the renowned anime "Initial D" into the project.

#### (I also created a .exe file of it and might upload it very soon)

## Input Keymaps:
